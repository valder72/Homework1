Task 9 â€” Music Festival Ticket Analyzer (No dicts, No functions) ðŸŽ¤

Constraints: lists + loops + conditions + strings + numbers only (NO dicts, NO def).

Scenario:
  Entrance logs are noisy strings with three data points:
    - Ticket ID starting with 'T' + digits (e.g., T123)
    - Age (e.g., age=21, AGE:17)
    - Zone name containing 'zone' (zoneA, ZONE_B, ZONE_C)

Example logs:
  logs = [
    "id:T123 age=21 zoneA",
    "noise T045 AGE=17 ZONE_B",
    "ticket T222 age:35 zoneA",
    "id:T045 age=17 zoneB (duplicate)",
    "bad line missing fields",
    "T555 age=12 ZONE_C",
  ]

Requirements:
  1) Extract for each line:
     - ticket id (string starting with 'T' + digits)
     - age (int)
     - zone label ('A', 'B', 'C') derived from zone token (case-insensitive)
     Ignore lines missing any of these three fields.

  2) Compute and print:
     - Valid tickets count
     - Minors (<18) count
     - Average age (1 decimal)
     - Zone counts as: A=?, B=?, C=?
     - Duplicates list (IDs that appear more than once)

Practice: string normalization, token scanning, counters, averages, duplicate detection

OUTPUT EXAMPLE
--------------
Valid tickets: 5
Minors: 2
Average age: 21.2
Zone counts: A=2, B=2, C=1
Duplicates: T045
